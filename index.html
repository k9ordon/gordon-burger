		<p>Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. What did he say? Both are hardworking and will serve you well.</p>
		<p>Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. Move him into position. Put him in.</p>
		<p>You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor. General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack</p>
		<p>Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. Han, can you reach my lightsaber? Yeah, sure. Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-op!! Wha--? Hey! Point that thing someplace else. Hey! Han, don't. It'll be all right. Chewie, give 'em your crossbow. Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness! Do you understand anything they're saying? Oh, yes, Master Luke! Remember that I am fluent in over six million forms of communication. What are you telling them? Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect. But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.</p>
		<p>Back door, huh? Good idea. It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. Then we'll do it real quiet-like. Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! Quiet. I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. Oh, no. There goes our surprise attack. Look! Over there! Stop him!</p>
